it would be better if i can split out a generic  'draw a card and take a turn' module, then implement my game as a seperate module (child or sibling?)
eg generic-card-game imports specific-card-game-rules
maybe make the cards themselves a seperate module. i think i should support png sprite and maybe svg (sprites?) later for the cards.
there should be a css rule for each card. so each card gets a unique id or class and implicit in that is a style. Primarily the 52 cards but custom-extendable later.
