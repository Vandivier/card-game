# Card Game
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theaccordance/card-dealer.svg?branch=master)] (https://travis-ci.org/theaccordance/card-dealer) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

It's a card game based on a standard 52 card deck, but it's not poker.

## Installation
Install for node.js using npm:

``` bash
$ npm install card-dealer
```

Serve the app:

``` bash
$ npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/

## Documentation
This will eventually be a card game. Right now it is pretty much an ng hello world with express on the back end and no db.

You could call it an EAN stack ;)
